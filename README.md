This script is intentionally simplifying real financial plans. This is expected to be insignificant compared to tax-rule changes or other life circumstances. You can define multiple contracts in series with a specified time window. 

Assumptions during each time window:
- deposits and withdrawals are performed yearly.
- tax rates and saving rates stay constant for each contract period.

Since simulations typically span many years, the real financial results can be subject to many changes.
