This script intentionally simplifies real financial plans. It is expected to be insignificant compared to tax-rule changes or other life circumstances. You can define multiple contracts in series with a specified time window.

Assumptions during each time window:

- yearly deposits and withdrawals;
- constant tax rates during a contract's time window;
- constant interest rates during a contract's time window.

Since simulations typically span many years, the real financial results can be subject to many changes.
